\section{Fine-Grained Visual Comparisons with Local Learning -- Rating: 4/5}
% summary
% RQ: how to idnetify neighboring training pairs: we show how to learn pairs analogous to the input, accounting for the attribute-specefic visual similarities.
To solve fine-grained viusal comparisons, the paper \cite{fine-grained} proposes a local learning approach to train comparative attributes based on fine-grained analogous pairs and introduces a new dataset specialized to the problem. The results indicate that more labeled data is not nessarily preferable to isolating the right data. \\

% positive #1: visual comparisons need not be transitive, so use local function rather global function
The authors propose an interesting idea about visual comparison. They think that the visual comparisons need not be transitive, so they choose local ranking function instead of global function. \\

% positive #2: compare two state-of-the-art method on three dataset
They did a large scale experiments on evaluating their methods. They've compared two state-of-the-art methods on three databases. I think the results have high reliability. \\

% positive #3: clear definition and queation
The approach is described by clear definition and equations. The reader can understand the detail much easier. \\

% criticism: how to choose the subtle detail parameter?
Choosing the suitable relative attribute between two images is a key for this method. If there is a dependency between two attribute, are the visual comparison results still not transitive?

\section{Scalable Multi-label Annotation -- Rating: 4/5}
Deng \emph{et~al.} \cite{Deng2014} address the scalablity issue of multi-label annotation. They proposes an algorithm that exploits correlation, hierarchy, and sparsity of the label distribution to yield significant savings for image labeling tasks.\\

% positive #1: 3 key observations
The paper clearly identifies three key obersvations for labels in real world scenarios. The labels are correlated, sparse and naturally form a hierarchy.\\

% positive #2:
The authors propose a theoretical analysis and a practical algorithm to satify the assumptions. They clearly define the utlity and cost function and use a pseudo code to describe the algorithm.\\

% positive #3:
The paper applys the algorithm on a real image dataset in real world scenarios. The results show that their algorithm accuires up to 6Ã— savings compared to the na\"{i}ve approach.\\

% criticism:
I wish they can provide a complete example to describe the process of anaylysis and demostrate the power of algorithm for reducing the costs. To achieve the goal of scalablity, we should select the high-utility queries with low cost. I wish the authors can provide their ideas on the trade-off between utility and cost.
