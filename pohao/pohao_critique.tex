\section{A Bayesian Method to Incorporate Background Knowledge during Automatic Text Summarization -- Rating: 4/5}
Louis \cite{Louis:ACL14} proposed another aspect in summarization, which focuses on extracting new text deviating from previous knowledge on the topic. They proposed an algorithm that exploits Bayesian and KL-divergence to extract new and important sentences.\\

% positive #1: 3 key observations
The paper proposed an interesting issue on summarization. Rather than extracting general importances for each document, extracting novel information is more helpful in some applications.\\

% positive #2:
This inspired me that summarization can be variable, here the summarization is varied with knowledge corpus. Maybe there are others, like time or weather.\\ 

% positive #3:
The setting of experiment and dataset is clear, but I wish they can provide the comparison between small and big background corpus for topic-based and surprise-based method.\\

% criticism:
I wish the paper can show the reason or comparison to use Dirichlet distribution to model hypothesis probability.
