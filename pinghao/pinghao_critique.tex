\section{Simultaneous Tracking & Activity Recognition (STAR)
Using Many Anonymous, Binary Sensors}

%subtitle:
Pros:\\

% positive #1:
1. Use only simple sensors like motion, pressure detectors instead of complicated, expensive ones to get a result.\\

% positive #2:
2. This work is highly applicapable and has great commercial value.\\

% positive #3:
3. It uses only filters with little training but does well in  practice.\\ 

% subtitle:
Cons:\\

% criticism:
It can not classify complicated activities.\\

\section{Online activity recognition using evolving classifiers}

%subtitle:
Pros:\\

% positive #1:
1. Using methods that works well on activity recognition in a growing data.\\

% positive #2:
2. Inherit many previous works trying on huge various of methods.\\

% positive #3:
3. Using only binary sensors to do on this work.\\ 

% subtitle:
Cons:
Using an unbalanced dataset.\\

% criticism:
